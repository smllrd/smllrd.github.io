# et cetera.

This is a Jekyll blog for me to get writing again, to collect my thoughts on life in Japan, my myriad abortive attempts at learning a programming language beyond HTML/CSS, and even learning how to write that properly.

I'll also talk about architecture, coffee and other stuff that pops up in day-to-day life.

## Themes for 2018

- The mental block that occurs after years of living in a second/third-language environment
- The inability to absorb abstract concepts in programming
- The Japanese urban environment and spatial design

## Licence
