Just a quick update.
We picked up the new car on 26th March and it's pretty good so far. Huge, even compared to the Odessey.

My daughter started at nursery this week, and it's the matriculation ceremony tomorrow. 

Last but not least, I enrolled in The Marketing Seminar.
I don't know how I'm going to find the time, but it should be pretty interesting.
