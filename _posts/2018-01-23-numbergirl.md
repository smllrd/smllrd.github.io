Around 2004/5, I read my first Haruki Murakami novel (*The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle*) and was getting into other Japanese authors like Yukio Mishima and Kenzaburo Oe.

I found a worldview that I hadn't experienced before, and a even though it was all in translation, I got hooked on learning tidbits of Japanese where I could, persuading my parents to buy me a book on "How to Learn Japanese in Thirty Days". (I would later meet the author as a history lecturer at the Schoold of Oriental and African Studies, even he admitted thirty days is impossible.)

My growing fascination with Japanese culture led me from literature to music, and one day I stumbled across a music website that had biographies and discographies of Japanese bands and musicians, [Musicwhore](http://archive.musicwhore.org/artist/bio/144/).

Seeing Mukai Shutoku's vocals compared to Kurt Cobain piqued my curiousity, and I scoured LimeWire and whatever other P2P service I used at the time for Number Girl songs, and I was blown away.

I'd never heard such a raw, screeching sound as Hisako Tabuchi's guitar; I was hooked.

I continued to search for Number Girl albums wherever I could, eventually resorting to PlayAsia and PayPal to have albums shipped from Japan, which I listened to all through Sixth Form.

Eventually, I decided to apply for a few Japanese courses at universities around the UK and eventually got into to SOAS.

13 years later, I'm living in Japan, and lucky enough to be married and raising a baby.

Without Number Girl, I can say I probably wouldn't be here. Thanks guys!
