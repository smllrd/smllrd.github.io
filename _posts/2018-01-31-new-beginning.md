Today my wife and I took our daughter to her future nursery for the first time.

She bawled her eyes out, but to see how happy she was when she saw us after the parent guidance talk put a smile on my face too.

In a little over two months, she'll be going there five days a week, it must be such a big deal for her at such an age.
Imagine being taken somewhere new and being left there without your parents for days on end, you'd probably cry too.

Anyway, it's a new beginning for her, but also for her parents too. We get to see how she is introduced to group activities with the other kids. Every day she grows little by little, I can't wait to see her grow and grow.
