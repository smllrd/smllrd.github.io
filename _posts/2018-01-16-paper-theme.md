I decided to update the blog theme from the standard Minima (which was a little too minimal nd had some conflict between the navigation and paginated items), to this [Paper Jekyll Theme](https://deadbeef.me/paper-jekyll-theme/) by [Mike JS Choi](https://github.com/mkchoi212). Thanks Mike!

Still a few things to move about, but this is a good first step and easy enough to get it on to Github pages.
