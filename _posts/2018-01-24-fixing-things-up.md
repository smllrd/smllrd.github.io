After a few days of tweaking Jekyll based on Michael Roses *Minimal Mistakes* theme, I'm getting close to what I want with the blog.

Still need to get more content up, but this is a start.

Next on the list, complete the About page and generate thumbnails for the posts listing, then I'd like to automate a few more tasks using gulp to cut down on time.
