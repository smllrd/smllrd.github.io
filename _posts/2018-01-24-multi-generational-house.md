Earlier I read in 住宅特集 (*Juutaku Tokushuu*, a home design magazine) about a house that consists of two near identical, long, rectangular units lined up in parallel, offset by about a third of the length of a unit, but joined on the second floor by a footbridge running perpendicularly between the two units.


[EDN101 on 住宅特集](http://www.japan-architect.co.jp/jp/works/index.php?book_cd=201712&pos=14&from=backnumber)

Each unit functions as a complete home in its own right, with all the basic facilities, but the footbridge connects them.

It's quite common in Japan, especially in rural areas for multiple generations of one family to live together under one roof. Three or even four generations if the great-grandparents are still around, share the same building, although in some cases a separate bathroom or kitchen may be built to accommodate the the rhythm of the lifestyle of different generations.

The footbridge between the houses struck me as interesting because instead of sharing the whole space, it put the two houses at a comfortable distance. This allows both sets of residents to get together when they want, and to have some privacy when they like.

I could consider something like that in the future.
