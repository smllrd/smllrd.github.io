If the biggest purchase most people make in their life is a new house, then the second is likely to be a new car, and that's what we sorted out yesterday.

We have been driving a 2005 Honda Odyssey for the past year, and it's almost given up the ghost. The car itself isn't bad, definitely a workhorse, but trying to fit baby and more than two people in it has become a big of a stretch, plus the regular trips to the dealer to get something fixed every few months has become a bit of a chore.

When we realised that the tax year is almost up and that we'd have to fork out for the repairs and tax, then we thought now would be the most cost-effective time to upgrade the car.

We ummed and ahhed about whether to go for the petrol engine or hybrid, but the discount from the dealer for the petrol had us sold.
We should be able to pick it up next week, nice.
