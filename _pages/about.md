## What is et cetera.?

et cetera. is a blog about daily life in Japan, through the eyes of Sam Ellard, a regular guy here living in Kansai.

## Why et cetera.?

Good question, why not "Japanblog1337"? Why not "Samurai Takoyaki Ninja Blog"?

In truth, I've always been terrible at writing on one focused topic, so I decided to stop worrying about it and just write about all the divergent interests in my life, all the stuff around the edges, the "etc" stuff, so I embraced the name.

## Who tf are you?

My name is Sam Ellard, I'm a salaryman in Kansai with a newborn baby, and I'm originally from London. I've worked in English teaching, and for a design office as a web admin. I always wanted to become skilled enough at writing, web development and Ruby, but never dedicated enough time to it. I hope this changes by writing this blog.
