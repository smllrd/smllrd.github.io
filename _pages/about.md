This is et cetera., the personal blog of Sam Ellard.

Why et cetera?
I have always had divergent interests, while never getting too deep into any one topic in particular. I could put this down to a lack of attention, but rather than bemoan my scattered interests, I thought I would embrace them in their variety.

This blog will mainly serve as practice for me in building a site based on Jekyll, documenting my progress in learning Ruby and my attempt at being a parent, life in Japan, etc. The etc. is the point.
